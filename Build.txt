Build instructions:
- to build release version just click on "pbuild.bat"
- to build debug version pass "debug" at the command line, for example, "pbuild.bat debug"

Comment: when I build the project on different systems sometimes I see clash in PATH definitions,
         so in case of problems I would recommend to run pbuild.bat from Tools -> Visual Studio Command Prompt

After successfull build two programs will be produced:
Programs\Doctor\bin\Release | Debug\DoctorDisplay.exe   (must be run on the physician's machine)
Programs\Patient\bin\Release | Debug\PatientDisplay.exe (must be running on the netbook located at the patient's chair)

- to cleanup everything run (click on) "pclean.bat"
