                     Build instructions
=============================================================

Build instructions:
- to build release version just click on  pbuild.bat
- to build debug version pass "debug" at the command line, for example, "build.bat debug"
- to register/unregitser filter copy register.bat, unregister.bat to Release|Debug directory  and run it 

Comment: when I build the project on different systems sometimes I see clash in PATH definitions,
         so in case of problems I would recommend to run pbuild.bat from Tools -> Visual Studio Command Prompt
